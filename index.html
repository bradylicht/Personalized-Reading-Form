            <h1>Welcome to Personalized Learning Tools!</h1>
            <p>This site is a collection of simple javascript tools to help personalize learning. While there are many great tools out there, there are some tasks that are currently not able to be personalized with any existing piece of technology. The majority of these tools are intended for a secondary audience, but personalized learning tools for adult learners may be included as well. Over time, more tools will be added to this site. You are welcome to use and modify these for educational purposes as long as attribution is provided. All other use is prohibited. </p>
            <h2>Personalized Learning In Action</h2>
            <p>Below are a collection of posters that illustrate the basic principles of personalized learning. These posters focus on personalized learning in 10th grade ELA course and remedial reading course at an alternative high school. In different contexts, personalized learning may look radically different.</p>
